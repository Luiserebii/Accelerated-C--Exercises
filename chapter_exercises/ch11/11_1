Q: The Student_info structure that we defined in Chapter 9 did not define
a copy constructor, assignment operator, or destructor. Why not?

The Student_info structure in Chapter 9 did not hold copies of pointers;
all data types used have their properly implemented copy constructors/
assignment operators/destructors, enough to have them function well
when recursively copied/assigned/destructed by default.

Dymanic memory allocation is where we are suddenly responsible for these
chunks of memory which involve manual allocation/creation/deallocation/
destruction. Even in new [T], where the allocation and creation is handled
in one, we still need to destroy it at some point. This thus explains the need
for destruction, and partially assignment.

Since copies of pointers will point to the same piece of memory, copy/assignment
does not work as expected recursively; thus requiring copy constructors and 
assignment operator implementation.

We can thus get away with using the default in the Ch. 9 class.
