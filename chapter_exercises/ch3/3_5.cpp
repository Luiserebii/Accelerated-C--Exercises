/*

Write a program that will keep track of grades for several students at once. The program could keep two vectors in sync: The first should hold the student's names, and the second the final grades that can be computed as input is read. For now, you should assume a fixed number of homework grades. We'll see in ยง4.1.3/56 how to handle a variable number of grades intermixed with student names.

The functionality of the program as follows:

-Queries list of midterm and final exam grades
-Asks for all of homework grades, followed by EOF
-Calculates final grade, which is 20% midterm, 40% final, 40% homework
